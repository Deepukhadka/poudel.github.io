A few of us from the office would go out to get momos for lunch from time to time. We frequented a momo place that sits directly on the other side of the road from where the office building is. To get to the other side of the road, one had to take the nearest zebra corssing which was only a bit further from the building.</p> <p>During one of those times, I saw one day that the road was a bit quieter than usual. Without thinking much, I foolishly proposed that we cross the road from there instead of walking over to the zebra crossing. Both of my coworkers looked at me like I was the newest incarnation of the devil.</p> <p>Their dislike of the idea was palpable, as was my embarrassment. But that small incident has stuck with me ever since. I still get tempted to jaywalk from time to time but I try to restrain myself. There are situations where I have no choice but to cross the road even if it's unsafe.</p> <p>As far as I can remember, I have always known that I should be using the zebra cross. I grew up reading it so many times, hearing it so many times from my parents and teachers. I don't remember anyone particularly telling me otherwise. But I also don't remember myself actively follow this rule. I've always crossed the road at my convenience, from anywhere I thought was safe enough. It's not like I was actively trying to avoid zebra crossings but I wasn't trying avoid crossing without them either.</p> <p>It made me wonder. Which is how I came to the conclusion that this was a cultural issue. Even though I was told many times that we should always use the zebra cross, I grew up around people who didn't care much about following the same rule.</p> <h2 id=zebra-crossing-paradox>Zebra-crossing paradox</h2> <p>I would say that it's not significantly safer for a pedestrian to use the zebra crossing in Kathmandu or anywhere in Nepal. I think that it might be riskier to use the zebra crossing sometimes.</p> <p>Find a zebra cross in Kathmandu valley, any one will do. Stand on the side and prepare yourself to go to the other side. Now if you take look at the vehicles approaching on your side, you'll notice that they usually <em>speed up</em> once they see that you are trying to cross the road.</p> <p>They want to go past the zebra cross before you cross so that they don't have to slow down or stop. The motorcyclists are the number one offenders in my experience. They rev it up the second they see you.</p> <p>Anyone can observe this phenomena in the roads of Kathmandu valley and see for it themselves. There will be exceptions, of course but very rare.</p> <p>I think this is also a cultural issue.</p> <p>With the rise of cooperative financial organizations, the majority of the general population has been able to afford to purchase motorcycles. They would not have been able to do that before because of the upfront cash required. But with financing made easy, they could simply bring some amount upfront and pay the rest on an installment basis.</p> <p>What I'm trying to get at is that there are many people who belong to the first ever generation of vehicle owners in their family. That is, none of their parents or grandparents had owned a motorized vehicle before. Which is how the collective responsibility of the formation of a traffic culture fell upon those new generation of vehicle owners throughout the country. They had full freedom. And like everything human beings are put in charge of creation, this culture thing also got moulded around individual convenience.</p> <p>For instance, I believe that the drivers don't want to slow down or stop in the zebra crossing because it is convenient not to. Changing gears, hitting breaks and et cetera takes an effort and we are wired from our childhood to avoid putting any effort for someone else's convenience because our own convenience ultimately trumps everybody else's.</p> <h2 id=end>End</h2> <p>For what it's worth, I also believe that we are currently going through a cultural shift that is headed towards a better direction. But it will take a whlie before we reach anywhere. The traffic police, for example, produces materials for different mediums to increase awareness and et cetera.</p> <p><em>This was an old draft and I had to remove/add a few paragraphs before I felt it was ready to be published.
