## Contact
I can be reached through email on `self@<this-domain>`.


## Bio
I am a full-stack software developer specializing in Python. I have more than two years
of software development experience. I have worked mainly with Python, Django and JavaScript.
I prefer working on the back-end side of things, although I have come to enjoy the front-end.
Although CSS is not exactly my forte, I can manage to get around most of the time.

Like any normal software developer of this age, I have a linkedin profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keshabpaudel/).


## Work Experience

### Janaki Technology / Khalti (September 2017 - Now)
I joined Janaki Technology to work on [Khalti](https://khalti.com/), mostly on the backend.
Ever since joining Khalti, I have learned so much about API, permissions et cetera.
I have also found love in JavaScript, both in the front and back end side.

It has only been a few months since I've been here so I don't have much to share, except that I am loving it.


### Real Solutions / merojob.com / AayuLogic (May 2015 - September 2017)
While at Real Solutions, I worked on [RealHRsoft](http://realhrsoft.com), an enterprise
Human Resource Management system. This was my first job ever. I was able to learn a lot
of things related to software development and many things about being a software
developer in today's world.
Some of the most key points about my experience by working on this project are as follows.

* The point where your software directly concerns with hardware is the most
  fragile. I learned it while trying to integrate attendance devices
  with the time and attendance subsystem. 
* Multi-tenancy is hard.
* Coding standards is a requirement.
* Automated testing is a requirement.
* Software development is really an iterative process.
* No matter how hard you try, the clientele will always find a way to complain and ask
  for more.
* Technical skills are easier to acquire than communication skills.
* It is essential to find a way to reduce stress.


## Technology Summary

* **Python:** Object Oriented Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Cython
* **JavaScript:** Mithril, ReactJS, Elm, VanillaJS, NodeJS
* **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL
* **Web:** HTML5, CSS, SaSS etc.

## This site
A simple, hotwired static site generator is used to build this site. It can be found
[here](https://github.com/poudel/poudel.github.io/blob/master/build.py)

I run the python script manually to build the whole site. I may need to think about
file monitoring, auto reload etc. if this gets bigger, but for now, this is perfectly fine.
To proof-read, I use `python -m http.server` to serve in development.
