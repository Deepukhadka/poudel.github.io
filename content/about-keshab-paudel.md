## Bio
I am a full-stack software developer specializing in Python. I have more than two years
of software development experience. I have worked mainly with Python, Django and JavaScript. Although I prefer working on the back-end side of things, I also enjoy the front-end. Even though CSS is not my forte, I can manage to get around most of the time.

Like any normal software developer of this age, I have a linkedin profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keshabpaudel/).

## Work Experience
### Real Solutions / merojob.com / AayuLogic (May 2015 - September 2017)
While at Real Solutions, I worked on [RealHRsoft](http://realhrsoft.com), an enterprise
Human Resource Management system. This was my first job ever. I was able to learn a lot
of things related to software development and many things about being a software
developer in today's world.
Some of the most key points about my experience by working on this project are as follows.

* The point where your software directly concerns with hardware is the most
  fragile. I learned it while trying to integrate attendance devices
  with the time and attendance subsystem. 
* Multi-tenancy is hard.
* Coding standards should be a requirement.
* Automated testing should be a requirement.
* Software development is really an iterative process.
* No matter how hard you try, the clientele will always find a way to complain and ask
  for more.
* Technical skills are easier to acquire than communication skills.
* Find a way to reduce stress.
