Like most of the people living in Kathmandu, I'm also from outside of Kathmandu. With the arrival the festival season, a familiar rush has also arrived.
For the next few weeks, more than a million people travel outside the valley to be with their family.
I will be one of them, hopefully, if I could get a bus ticket in time.

I have been visiting these ticket counters every morning and evening for the last couple of days.
I have had to return empty handed every single time. This morning, on the way back,
there was enough time for me to contemplate.
This is not a one time issue, it repeats every year. When the festival season starts,
I have a hard time overcoming the anxiety created by the high possibility of not getting
a ticket home until I get one.

I believe that if managed properly, there are enough vehicles for everyone.
I may be wrong since I haven't checked the statistics and am not aware of
vehicle to passengers ratio.

## Problems
This is what I realized while I was walking back home this morning. This problem
is not just one factor.
