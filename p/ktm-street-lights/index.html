That was a year ago when I was returning home from work, from Pulchowk to Anamnagar. The bridge in question is the one that joins Thapathali and Kopundol.</p> <p>There was a heavy rainfall a few days ago. When I was walking back home that evening, I paused on the middle of the bridge to see the grown river. The rain must have given its top performance that day because I could hear the river growling even though the sound was suppressed by the stream of vehicles waiting on the bridge for the traffic jam at Thapathali to clear.</p> <p>A light on a nearby post starts flickering. The impeccably timed lightening strike on the horizon shakes my already nervous disposition. It's about to rain again so I hurry up. I had forgotten to carry my umbrella that day.</p> <p>The sidewalks on the bridge are also not of equal width. I wonder who fucked those measurements up. On a second thought, it was probably shortened to skim money off of the budget.</p> <p>I reach Maitighar and take the road that follows along the wall of Singhadurbar. When I reach Hanumansthan, I am greeted by another pair of flickering lights. The first one blinks about 4 times per second and the second one blinks once every 5 seconds approximately. The first one hurts my eyes, I try to lessen the exposure by closing my eyes when I'm directly under it. The raining is about to start.</p> <p>The second light feels like it's counting something, it blinks slowly. It's probably counting down to the moment when someone is finally going to notice it's plead for retirement. That is, if it doesn't burn out before that. Besides, important people don't have to take these roads, especially on the evening.</p> </div> </div> <div class=footer> <a href=/ >Home</a> | <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/poudel>Github</a> | <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/keshabpaudel/ target=_blank>Linkedin</a> | <a href=/sitemaps.xml>Sitemaps</a> | Since 2017 </div> </div> </body> </html>
