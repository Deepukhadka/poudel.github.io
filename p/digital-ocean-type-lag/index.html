This post was a draft from that time. I don't have the droplet anymore but, I am going to publish this post just in case some other person has to go through the same issue.</p> <p>The data center region I chose while creating the droplet was New York. Now this would not have been an issue if I wasn't living halfway across the world, in Nepal. Although the site served through this droplet was loading fine, the SSH shell connected to it would lag horribly. The terminal would only show a character I typed after half a second of actually typing. Needless to say, it was quite frustrating. I ran out of patience not long after that.</p> <p>I looked around the internet and found that it was because of network latency. I moved the location of the droplet to an Indian datacenter by following <a target=_blank href=https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-migrate-digitalocean-droplets-using-snapshots>this tutorial</a>.</p> <p>After this, the annoying latency issue was resolved.</p> </div> </div> <div class=footer> <a href=/ >Home</a> | <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/poudel>Github</a> | <a href=/sitemaps.xml>Sitemaps</a> | Since 2017 </div> </div> </body> </html>
