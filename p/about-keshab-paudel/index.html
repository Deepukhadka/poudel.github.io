<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I am a full-stack software developer specializing in Python. I have more than two years
of software development experience. I have worked mainly with Python, Django and JavaScript. Although I prefer working on the back-end side of things, I also enjoy the front-end. Even though CSS is not my forte, I can manage to get around most of the time.</p>

<p>Like any normal software developer of this age, I have a linkedin profile <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keshabpaudel/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h3>Real Solutions / merojob.com / AayuLogic (May 2015 - September 2017)</h3>

<p>While at Real Solutions, I worked on <a target="_blank" href="http://realhrsoft.com">RealHRsoft</a>, an enterprise
Human Resource Management system. This was my first job ever. I was able to learn a lot
of things related to software development and many things about being a software
developer in today's world.
Some of the most key points about my experience by working on this project are as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>The point where your software directly concerns with hardware is the most
fragile. I learned it while trying to integrate attendance devices
with the time and attendance subsystem. </li>
<li>Multi-tenancy is hard.</li>
<li>Coding standards should be a requirement.</li>
<li>Automated testing should be a requirement.</li>
<li>Software development is really an iterative process.</li>
<li>No matter how hard you try, the clientele will always find a way to complain and ask
for more.</li>
<li>Technical skills are easier to acquire than communication skills.</li>
<li>Find a way to reduce stress.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technology Summary</h2>

<p>Some of the technologies I have dabbled and enjoy working with in no particular order.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Python:</strong> Object Oriented Python, Django, Cython</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> jQuery, AngularJS, VanillaJS</li>
