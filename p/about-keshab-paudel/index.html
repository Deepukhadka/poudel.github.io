This reads like a resume by intention. <a href=/ >[Table of Contents]</a> </div> </div> <div class=content> <div class=pd> <div class=psub>2017-09-07 / Kathmandu, Nepal</div> <h2>Contact</h2> <p>I can be reached through email on <code>self@&lt;this-domain&gt;</code>.</p> <h2>Bio</h2> <p>I am a full-stack software developer specializing in Python. I have more than two years of software development experience. I have worked mainly with Python, Django and JavaScript. I prefer working on the back-end side of things, although I have come to enjoy the front-end. Although CSS is not exactly my forte, I can manage to get around most of the time.</p> <p>Like any normal software developer of this age, I have a linkedin profile <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/keshabpaudel/ target=_blank>here</a>.</p> <h2>Work Experience</h2> <h3>Janaki Technology / Khalti (September 2017 - Now)</h3> <p>I joined Janaki Technology to work on <a href=https://khalti.com/ target=_blank>Khalti</a>, mostly on the backend. Ever since joining Khalti, I have learned so much about API, permissions et cetera. I have also found love in JavaScript, both in the front and back end side.</p> <p>It has only been a few months since I've been here so I don't have much to share, except that I am loving it.</p> <h3>Real Solutions / merojob.com / AayuLogic (May 2015 - September 2017)</h3> <p>While at Real Solutions, I worked on <a target=_blank href=http://realhrsoft.com>RealHRsoft</a>, an enterprise Human Resource Management system. This was my first job ever. I was able to learn a lot of things related to software development and many things about being a software developer in today's world. Some of the most key points about my experience by working on this project are as follows.</p> <ul> <li>The point where your software directly concerns with hardware is the most fragile. I learned it while trying to integrate attendance devices with the time and attendance subsystem. </li> <li>Multi-tenancy is hard.</li> <li>Coding standards is a requirement.</li> <li>Automated testing is a requirement.</li> <li>Software development is really an iterative process.</li> <li>No matter how hard you try, the clientele will always find a way to complain and ask for more.</li> <li>Technical skills are easier to acquire than communication skills.</li> <li>It is essential to find a way to reduce stress.</li> </ul> <h2>Technology Summary</h2> <p>Some of the technologies I have dabbled and enjoy working with in no particular order.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Python:</strong> Object Oriented Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Cython</li> <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Mithril, ReactJS, Elm, VanillaJS, NodeJS</li> <li><strong>Databases:</strong> MySQL, PostgreSQL</li> <li><strong>Web:</strong> HTML5, CSS, SaSS etc.</li> <li><strong>Linux Distros:</strong> CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, ArchLinux etc.</li> <li><strong>Editor/IDE:</strong> Currently using Emacs. Have used Vim, Sublime Text, Pycharm et cetera in the past.</li> <li><strong>Dabbled with:</strong> Golang, TypeScript, PHP, Java, Elixir, LaTeX, Emacs Lisp, C et cetera.</li> </ul> <h2>This site</h2> <p>A simple, hotwired static site generator is used to build this site. It can be found <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/poudel/poudel.github.io/blob/master/build.py>here</a></p> <p>I run the python script manually to build the whole site. I may need to think about file monitoring, auto reload etc. if this gets bigger, but for now, this is perfectly fine. To proof-read, I use <code>python -m http.server</code> to serve in development.</p> </div> </div> <div class=footer> <a href=/ >Home</a> | <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/poudel>Github</a> | <a href=/sitemaps.xml>Sitemaps</a> | Since 2017 </div> </div> </body> </html>
